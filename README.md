# nerve

A bespoke, single-developer AI agent harness. Lean enough to hold in your head, transparent enough that the agent running *inside* it can safely refactor its own machinery mid-session.

> **nerve** — because the whole point is to *feel every token* as it streams, and to splice into the wire mid-thought.

## What this is (and isn't)

- **Not** a `claude-code` / `opencode` clone. No generic framework, no plugin marketplace, no provider zoo.
- **A personal coding agent.** Operates on the dir you launch it in — reads, edits, runs shell, iterates on code.
- **Self-hackable above all.** Every part is small, flat, and obvious so that a human *or the LLM in the loop* can **hot-swap a tool or an interceptor at runtime** (`/reload`, no restart) without spelunking. Launched inside this repo, the agent can edit its own harness.
- **Two providers, hardcoded:** **Google Gemini** and **DeepSeek**. Nothing else. No Anthropic, no OpenAI, no OpenRouter, no LangChain. The absence of an aggregator layer is a feature.
- **Bun-native, strict TypeScript, ESM only.** Zero legacy Node bloat.
- **OpenTUI** ([`@opentui/core`](https://github.com/sst/opentui)) for the terminal UI — imperative core API, no React layer unless a screen earns it.

If an abstraction doesn't pay rent today, it isn't here. The *why* of every choice lives in
[AGENT_RULES.md](docs/AGENT_RULES.md); the *what* (with rejected alternatives) in [DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md).

## Defining features

- **The "nerve":** a synchronous, per-delta **interceptor pipeline** — splice into the model's
  output between tokens to observe, rewrite, drop, or `abort()` mid-stream. Ships with token-tap,
  live stop-guard, reasoning router, and secret redaction.
- **Hashline editing:** the only edit path. `read` tags each line `LINE#HASH:content`; edits point
  at hash anchors instead of retyping lines (fewer tokens), and a stale read is hard-rejected
  before it can corrupt a file. Zero deps (`Bun.hash`).
- **Two human-controlled modes:** **PLAN** (read-only — read tools + obviously-safe bash) and
  **YOLO** (everything auto). Switched only by you (`Shift+Tab`); the model can't escalate.
- **Hot-swap seams:** reload tools + interceptors live without losing the conversation.
- **Resumable sessions:** append-only JSONL transcripts you can replay and grep.
- **LSP code intelligence:** a raw, zero-dep Language Server client. `edit`/`write`/`read` append
  diagnostics so the agent self-corrects, and an `lsp` tool gives it definition/references/hover/
  symbols (read-only, so it works in PLAN mode). Seeded for TypeScript. *(Phase 2.)*
- **Claude-compatible:** loads `CLAUDE.md` (layered from `~/.claude` + workspace `./.claude` + root)
  into the system prompt, and discovers skills from `~/.claude/skills` + `./.claude/skills` — so your
  existing Claude ecosystem (like the bundled `opentui` skill) just works.
- **Self-documenting:** a `manual` tool serves nerve's own operator manual (`docs/manual/`) — the
  agent reads "how X works / how to change X" before it touches X. The OpenTUI API is federated in
  lazily (`manual("opentui")`), so our only dependency's docs cost context only when the UI is touched.

## Quick start

```bash
bun install
bun run dev          # bun --watch index.ts (restarts the TUI on change)
bun test             # bun:test
bun run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
```

Configure keys and models — **keys in `.env`** (Bun loads it automatically — no dotenv),
**models in `config/models.json`** (schema-backed, so you get IntelliSense + validation while editing):

```sh
# .env  (gitignored)
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...
```

```jsonc
// config/models.json  (committed catalog — no secrets). The $schema ref drives editor IntelliSense.
{
  "$schema": "./models.schema.json",
  "models": [
    { "id": "deepseek-v4-flash", "provider": "deepseek", "default": true },
    { "id": "gemini-3.5-pro",    "provider": "gemini" }
  ]
}
```

## Proposed directory map (flat by design)

Phase 0 (this commit) establishes only context + config. Phase 1 fills `src/`. The target shape:

## Documents

- [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) — the standing decision log: every choice, its rationale, and the alternatives it beat.
- [docs/AGENT_RULES.md](docs/AGENT_RULES.md) — anti-redundancy mandate, self-hackability rules, the human-only safety boundaries, the strict two-provider scope.
- [.claude/CLAUDE.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md) — operational guidelines for an agent working *on* this repo (loaded via the root `CLAUDE.md` import).
